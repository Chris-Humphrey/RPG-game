# RPG GAME IN COMMAND LINE
This is a terminal based RPG Game programed in Python 3. I made this game in Week 2 of DigitalCrafts. The main purpose of this project is to learn the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming. 

## Characters

## How to play
<ol>
<li>If you don't have python3 (If you have Python3, skip this.)
download python 3 for your OS.</li>
https://www.python.org/downloads/

<p>Make sure your dependencies are all there</p>

<li>Clone this repo to your local machine.</li>
https://github.com/hirosoft40/RPGgame.git

<li>Open Terminal and play!</li>
</ol>

## Language
<ul><li> Python3 </li></ul>


## Features
I have implemented few things so that a game beginner like myself can enjoy also.
<ol>
<h3><li> Gem Mountain</li></h3>
<p>Users mind changes. Sometimes they want to play games, sometimes they are tired of attacking. So, I have created gem Mountain to play a very simple game. </p>

<h3><li> Anime style emotions </li></h3>
<p>I have added Anime style emotions so that users can enjoy more without reading letters.</p>

<h3><li> Error Handlings </li></h3>
<p>This game prompt user inputs. Therefore I spent more time on coding error handling.</p>

</ol>

## My Challenge
I am not a game person. So my biggest challenge was to learn more about how RPG game works. I interviewed few family members and then I was able to come up with specifications. 
<br>
The other challenge was to understand Class. I was introduced to Class first time, and it took me some time to fully understand thought the concept seemed clear. The best way to learn is to code. So I coded, did some research and coded again.

## After coding
I enjoyed coding python3 and I enjoyed this project. As I code and implemented anime style emotions, error handling and other features, I am happy on how it turned.
