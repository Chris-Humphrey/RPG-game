# RPG GAME IN COMMAND LINE
This is a terminal based RPG Game programed in Python 3. I made this game in Week 2 of DigitalCrafts. The main purpose of this project is to learn the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming.

## Features
I have implemented few things so that a game beginner like myself can enjoy also.
<ol>
<h3><li> Gem Mountain</li></h3>
<p>Users mind changes. Sometimes they want to play games, sometimes they are tired of attacking. So, I have created gem Mountain to play a very simple game. </p>

<h3><li> Anime style emotions </li></h3>
<p>I have added Anime style emotions so that users can enjoy more without reading letters.</p>

<p>This game prompts user inputs, therefore, I have made sure to optimize error handling.</p>
